                Burlington Barracudas Rep Program</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(54, 96, 146);">Welcome to
        the Burlington Girls Hockey Club, home of the Barracudas. Our competitive program strives to develop young
        athletes who have a strong desire to compete against the best female hockey players in Ontario. Over the years
        the BGHC has placed players on the NCAA (D1,D3) teams and CIS teams,&nbsp;on Team Ontario&nbsp;and&nbsp;at the
        National level. This all starts with our non-competitive Timbit league and continues on to the Provincial
        Women&rsquo;s Hockey League (Junior). In fact, the Burlington Barracudas&nbsp;is one of only a handful of
        Ontario organizations that run teams at the highest level in all age categories, from Novice through to
        Junior.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(54, 96, 146);">We want our
        athletes and their families to enjoy the experience, the friendships, the one on one time traveling to games,
        and to remember - &nbsp;it is only a game</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(54, 96, 146);">Inquiries on
        the Barracudas competitive teams should be directed to the Director of Competitive Teams at
